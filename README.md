# Kage
A real-time displayed multimedia projection system based on Android.

## What's this?
This application is my graduation project. First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Professor Xu, for his intellectual guidance, invaluable instructions and comments on my thesis. It is with his valuable assistance that I have finally accomplished this thesis.

Kage(かげ), means "shadow", which means that the sending end and the receiving end are consistent like an object and its shadow. The innovations of this application are as follows:

- A real-time displayed multimedia projection system
- Adapt to different sizes and different models of devices
- Integrate the sending end and receiving end in the same application
